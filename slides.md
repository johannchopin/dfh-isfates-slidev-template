# Code
<Hr />

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly!

```ts
interface User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  role: string
}

function updateUser(id: number, update: Partial<User>) {
  const user = getUser(id)
  const newUser = { ...user, ...update }
  saveUser(id, newUser)
}
```
